Following several constitutional conferences, the British North America Act 1867 officially
proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.[72][73] Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and
the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the MÃ©tis' grievances
ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870.
British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation
in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within
10 years, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush
in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan
became provinces in 1905. Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population
emigrated southwards, to the U.S.
To open the West and encourage European immigration, Parliament approved sponsoring the construction
of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to
settlement with the Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its
authority over this territory. This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted
in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to "Indian reserves", clearing
the way for ethnic European block settlements.[81] This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in
western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land.
The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their
traditional hunting lands.[83] The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition
of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.[84] During this time, Canada introduced the Indian
Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.
